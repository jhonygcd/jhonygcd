## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**jhonygcd/jhonygcd** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on regular updates for my project, which is an online sales system.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning about Internet of Things and MySQL Workbench.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects involving Python, as I have a fairly good knowledge of this language.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking help to master additional programming languages and to gain more experience in the field.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about motorcycles and cars; these are topics Iâ€™m passionate about.
